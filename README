SMUHPC Workshop README
======================

In this directory and below are both the source code files, and the
resulting web pages, for the SMUHPC new user workshop. They are
written using the ReST [1] formatting language, which is parsed into
final formats using the Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx include:

* ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text, so a simple copy/paste from other formats
  generates a good first pass at the pages.

* Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most 
  notably HTML and a PDF.

To build the docs, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed (version
1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer).  If you
are using a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint), this 
may be easily accomplished via

  $ sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

If instead you are using a RedHat-based Linux distribution, you may be
able to use

  $ sudo yum install python-sphinx10

To download the files, it is recommended to use the Mercurial [4]
"clone" command to retrieve the repository, so that changes can easily 
be pushed back up to Bitbucket.  Again, in Debian-based Linux
distributions, you can install Mercurial via

  $ sudo apt-get install mercurial

Similarly, if instead you are using a RedHat-based Linux distribution,
you may be able to use

  $ sudo yum install mercurial

The clone command would then be either

  $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/drreynolds/smuhpc-workshop

or 

  $ hg clone https://drreynolds@bitbucket.org/drreynolds/smuhpc-workshop

Alternately, you may click the (download) link at the right of the
main repository page on Bitbucket; however this will only retrieve the 
files, not allow you to easily share your changes with the group or
update your files with our changes.

To build the HTML site from the provided sources, use the two commands
from the top-level subdirectory:

  $ make clean

  $ make html

If that is successful, open the file build/html/index.html in your web
browser (relative to this directory).
