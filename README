SMUHPC Workshop README
======================

In this directory and below are both the source code files, and the
resulting web pages, for the SMUHPC new user workshop. They are written
using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed into final formats using the
Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Here are some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text, so a simple copy/paste from other formats
  generates a good first pass at the pages.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most
  notably HTML and a PDF.

To build the docs, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed (version
1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer).

To build the HTML site from the provided sources, use the two commands
from the top-level workshop subdirectory:
  $ make clean
  $ make html
If that is successful, open the file build/html/index.html in your web
browser (relative to this directory).

To build the documents in PDF (requires pdflatex [4] to be installed),
use the two commands: 
  $ make clean
  $ make latexpdf
If this is successful, the PDF file will be located in
build/latex/ARKode.pdf.  

If pdflatex is not functioning properly, you may instead try
  $ make clean
  $ make latex
This will build the raw LaTeX source file
build/latex/SMUHPCWorkshop.tex, that you may then compile into a PS or
DVI file as desired.
