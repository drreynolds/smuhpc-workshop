SMUHPC Workshop README
======================

In this directory and below are both the source code files, and the
resulting web pages, for the SMUHPC new user workshop. They are written
using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed into final formats using the
Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Here are some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text, so a simple copy/paste from other formats
  generates a good first pass at the pages.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most
  notably HTML and a PDF.

To build the docs, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed (version
1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer).  If you
are using a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint), this
may be easily accomplished via
  $ sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

To download the files, it is recommended to use the Mercurial [4]
"clone" command to retrieve the repository, so that changes can easily
be pushed back up to Bitbucket.  Again, in Debian-based Linux
distributions, you can install Mercurial via
  $ sudo apt-get install mercurial

The clone command would then be 
  $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/drreynolds/smuhpc-workshop

Alternately, you may click the (download) link at the right of the
main repository page on Bitbucket; however this will only retrieve the
files, not allow you to easily share your changes with the group or
update your files with our changes.

To build the HTML site from the provided sources, use the two commands
from the top-level subdirectory:
  $ make clean
  $ make html
If that is successful, open the file build/html/index.html in your web
browser (relative to this directory).

To build the documents in PDF (requires pdflatex [5] to be installed),
use the two commands: 
  $ make clean
  $ make latexpdf
If this is successful, the PDF file will be located in
build/latex/ARKode.pdf.  

If pdflatex is not functioning properly, you may instead try
  $ make clean
  $ make latex
This will build the raw LaTeX source file
build/latex/SMUHPCWorkshop.tex, that you may then compile into a PS or
DVI file as desired.
