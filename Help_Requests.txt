Software installs/updates:
* [critical] Installed Python version is too old to use
  post-processing example. Need Python 2.7, along with updated Numpy,
  Matplotlib modules.  I have these installed in my home directory,
  inside ~dreynolds/sw/yt_dev/ if needed.
* [critical] Mercurial.  Again, I have it installed in my home
  directory, inside ~dreynolds/sw/bin
* [critical] Git
* [not critical] Module for updated GNU compilers (default is 4.1.2).
  Again, I have much newer versions compiled in my home directory
  (4.7.1), in ~dreynolds/sw/bin
* [not critical] Module for mvapich2 using updated GNU compilers.



I need login access to gpu2

Why is Matlab not in the default PATH on the login nodes (is it even
on the compute nodes)?  There isn't even a module available for it.



Web page/tutorial content help:

Modules:
* links to documentation on our Module system (if it exists)
* list of module highlights
* high-level description of how module works
* list of module functions (e.g. avail, add, swap)
* example: hard way to compile something, then easy way to do the same
  once module is used.
* exercise: set up relevant modules to use a set of packages, then set
  up Makefile to use new environment variables to easily build a piece
  of source code.

PGI:
* Do we have a fancier performance monitoring system and/or debugger
  for PGI than the basic GNU tools?

SMUHPC:
* Updates to basic hardware component list (I got mine from the wiki)
* Condor updates, details (overall information, options, etc).
* Details on the SMUHPC networks.
* Updates to parallel computing abilities on SMUHPC (if I missed
  anything or stated anything incorrectly).
* Updates on how to compile/launch MPI jobs on the different parallel
  portions of SMUHPC, if it has been at all simplified from how it was
  before. 

General:
* Ideas on an exercise for students to do with BASH scripts?
* Ideas on an exercise for students to do with Python scripts?
  (codecademy has lots of Python exercises, maybe point users there 
  and ask them to do a handful of exercises)
