I need login access to gpu2

I'd like a place to host this set of web tutorials (a basic web
server, not a content manager), including space to place all example
codes for download.  

What is the main purpose of smuhpc3.smu.edu?



Web page/tutorial content help:

Modules:
* links to documentation on our Module system (if it exists)
* list of module highlights
* high-level description of how module works
* list of module functions (e.g. avail, add, swap)
* example: hard way to compile something, then easy way to do the same
  once module is used.
* exercise: set up relevant modules to use a set of packages, then set
  up Makefile to use new environment variables to easily build a piece
  of source code.

PGI:
* Do we have a fancier performance monitoring system and/or debugger
  for PGI than the basic GNU tools?

SMUHPC:
* Updates to basic hardware component list (I got mine from the wiki)
* Condor updates, details (overall information, options, etc).
* Details on the SMUHPC networks.
* Updates to parallel computing abilities on SMUHPC (if I missed
  anything or stated anything incorrectly).
* Updates on how to compile/launch MPI jobs on the different parallel
  portions of SMUHPC, if it has been at all simplified from how it was
  before.
