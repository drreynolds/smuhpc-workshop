Makefiles
------------------------------------------------------

The make command allows programmers to manage large programs or groups of programs. It aids in developing large programs by keeping track of which portions of the entire program have been changed, compiling only those parts of the program which have changed since the last compile.

The make program gets its set of compile rules from a text file called Makefile which resides in the same directory as the source files. It contains information on how to compile the software, e.g. the compiler to use, the optimization level, whether to include debugging info in the executable, etc.. It also contains information on where to install the finished compiled binaries (executables), manual pages, data files, dependent library files, configuration files, etc.

Some packages require you to edit the Makefile manually to set the
final installation directory and any other parameters. However, many
packages are now being distributed with the GNU configure utility.
